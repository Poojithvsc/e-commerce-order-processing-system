# My Learning Project Requirements

## What I Want to Learn
I want to find a completed, working project that is publicly available on GitHub to learn about:
- Java
- S3/Object Storage
- Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Cloud technologies
- Docker
- Kafka (optional)
- REST APIs
- Modern backend architecture

## Requirements for the Project
1. **Must be publicly available on GitHub**
2. **Must be a complete, working project** (not a tutorial or incomplete demo)
3. **Must use multiple technologies** (database, storage, messaging, etc.)
4. **Must have good documentation**
5. **Must be runnable with Docker** (preferably)

## What I Need Help With
1. **Find and download** the project to: `D:\Tinku anna project\project 3`
2. **Explain everything**:
   - What each technology does
   - How they work together
   - Why things are done a certain way
   - What alternatives exist and why this approach was chosen
3. **Guide me on how to run it**
4. **Walk through the code** and architecture
5. **Help me explore** all features and options

## Working Directory
**All work must be done in:** `D:\Tinku anna project\project 3`

## How to Start a New Session
If I open a new terminal:
1. Navigate to: `cd "D:\Tinku anna project\project 3"`
2. Open Claude Code in this directory
3. Reference this file: "Read MY-LEARNING-REQUIREMENTS.md and continue helping me learn the project"
